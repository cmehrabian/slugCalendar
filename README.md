#Slug Calendar
The ultimate calendar resource for UCSC students!

SlugCal currently scrapes online calendars of five colleges located on the UC Santa Cruz campus.
Events are colored based upon the inherit color designated to each college.
Each event consists of the title, where, when, and a chat room where you can discuss the event. 
You can also filter to show only specific colleges event with the buttons located at the top of the page.
There is a still a lot of work to do for this to accessible and useful for the student population.
<h3>Still in development</h3> but you can find a current version <a href src="http://slugcalendar.meteor.com">here</a>
